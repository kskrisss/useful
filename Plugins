Enable the plugins you want by editing your ~/.zshrc file.

Example:

plugins=(rails git ruby)
Completion plugins will let zsh know which arguments the package has so it can autocomplete. For instance, if you have the Homebrew plugin installed and type:

brew in
.. and then hit tab, the brew plugin will enable autocompletion to brew install. Completion plugins are not documented further on this page as they only provide better introspection for zsh into the original command. man is your friend.

You should always read the source for the plugin before using it to avoid surprises. Plugins are located in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins.

dircycle

This is a small zle trick that lets you cycle your directory stack left or right using Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right. This is useful when moving back and forth between directories in development environments, and can be thought of as kind of a nondestructive pushd/popd.

dirhistory

Maintainer: [jeffwilliams][jeffwilliams]

This plugin allows you to navigate the history of previous current-working-directories using ALT-LEFT and ALT-RIGHT. ALT-LEFT moves back to directories that the user has changed to in the past, and ALT-RIGHT undoes ALT-LEFT.

For example, if the shell was started, and the following commands were entered:

cd ~
cd /usr
cd share
cd doc
Then entering ALT-LEFT at the prompt would change directory from /usr/share/doc to /usr/share, then if pressed again to /usr/, then ~. If ALT-RIGHT were pressed the directory would be changed to /usr/ again.

Currently the max history size is 100. The navigation should work for xterm, PuTTY xterm mode, and GNU screen.

wd

Maintainer: mfaerevaag

wd (warp directory) lets you jump to custom directories in zsh, without using cd. Why? Because cd seems inefficient when the folder is frequently visited or has a long path. Source

Print usage with no opts or the help argument.

Examples:

Add warp point to current working directory:

wd add test
If a warp point with the same name exists, use add! to overwrite it.

Examples:

From an other directory, warp to test with:

wd test
You can warp back to previous directory, and so on, with the puncticulation syntax:

wd ..
wd ...
This is a wrapper for the zsh dirs function.

Remove warp point test point:

wd rm test
List warp points to current directory (stored in ~/.warprc):

wd show
List all warp points (stored in ~/.warprc):

wd list
